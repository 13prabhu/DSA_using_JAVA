# DSA_with_JAVA🚀
This repository is a collection of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice problems and solutions implemented in Java. The aim is to strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts while enhancing coding proficiency.
## 📚 Contents
The repository is organized into different sections for easy navigation:

->Array
Problems like sorting, searching, and manipulation.

->Linked List
Implementations and problems like merging, reversing, and detecting loops.

->Stack and Queue
Applications and problems using stacks and queues.

->Recursion and Backtracking
Solving problems using recursion and exploring different paths.

->Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
Traversals, insertions, deletions, and common operations.

->Graphs
Representation, BFS, DFS, and other graph algorithms.

->Dynamic Programming
Solving problems using memoization and tabulation techniques.

->Strings
String manipulation and pattern matching.

-> Sorting and Searching Algorithms
Standard algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.

->Miscellaneous
Other common DSA problems and interview questions.
